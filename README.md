**21th Feb to 25th Feb**
## Querying database
In this week I learnt about various topics - 
#### Operator :
* An operator is a reserved word or a character that is used to query our database in a SQL expression.
* To query a database using operators, we use a WHERE clause. Operators are necessary to define a condition in SQL, as they act as a connector between two or more conditions.

#### Aggregate :
* SQL aggregation is the task of collecting a set of values to return a single value. 
* It is done with the help of aggregate functions, such as SUM, COUNT, and AVG.

#### Joins :
* SQL Join statement is used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them. Different types of Joins are as follows: INNER JOIN. LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN etc.

#### Subquery : 
* A Subquery is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the WHERE clause. A subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved.

**28th Feb to 4th March**
## Data Warehouse and ETL
Basic concepts of data warehose and etl were shared. Case study on same was provided to study.
#### Data warehouse
* A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence.
* The three main types of data warehouses are enterprise data warehouse (EDW), operational data store (ODS), and data mart.

#### ETL
* ETL is a type of data integration that refers to the three steps (extract, transform, load) used to blend data from multiple sources. It's often used to build a data warehouse.
* ETL Data Warehouse process is used to load data from data sources to Data Warehouse in a common standard format. 
* ETL tools break down data silos and make it easy for your data scientists to access and analyze data, and turn it into business intelligence. In short, ETL tools are the first essential step in the data warehousing process that eventually lets you make more informed decisions in less time.

**7th March to 11th March**
## Unix and Shell Scripting
Various concepts regarding unix and shell scripting were told. Practice question for same were given.
- Unix is a computer Operating System which is capable of handling activities from multiple users at the same time. 
- The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.
- The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the operating system or the kernel. Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the shell. 
- A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.
- Shell scripts have several required constructs that tell the shell environment what to do and when to do it.

**14th March to 18th March**
## SQL Server 
Advanced concept of SQL like stored procedure, functions, triggers and cursors were taught in this week. Downloaded Microsoft SQL server and learnt how to operate it. 
#### Stored Procedure
- A stored procedure in SQL is a group of SQL statements that are stored together in a database. Based on the statements in the procedure and the parameters you pass, it can perform one or multiple DML operations on the database, and return value, if any.

#### Triggers
- A SQL trigger is a database object which fires when an event occurs in a database. We can execute a SQL query that will "do something" in a database when a change occurs on a database table such as a record is inserted or updated or deleted.

#### Cursors
- A cursor in SQL is a temporary work area created in system memory when a SQL statement is executed. A SQL cursor is a set of rows together with a pointer that identifies a current row. It is a database object to retrieve data from a result set one row at a time.

#### Error Handling
- Error handling refers to the response and recovery procedures from error conditions present in a software application. It is the process comprised of anticipation, detection and resolution of application errors, programming errors or communication errors.

## SSIS
SSIS stands for SQL Server Integration Service. For its implementation we were made to install Visual Studio. 
- Integration Services can extract and transform data from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.
- SSIS tool also contains the graphical tools and window wizards workflow functions such as sending email messages, ftp operations, data sources.
- SSIS is a tool mainly used to perform two functionalities:
  * Data Integration - SSIS performs data integration by combining the data from multiple sources and provides unified data to the users.
  * Workflow -  It can be used to automate the maintenance of SQL Server databases and provides the update to the multidimensional analytical data.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

**4th April to 8th April**
## SSAS
SSAS stands for SQL Server Analysis Service. Its implementation was also done on visual studio.
- SSAS is Microsoft SQL Server's Analysis Services which is an online analytical processing (OLAP), data mining, and reporting tool used in Business Intelligence to make data work for end-users.
- you can use SSAS to create cubes using data from data marts / data warehouse for deeper and faster data analysis.
- SSAS Database is to analyze and predict data utilizing cubes and data mining Structures. Since different objects exist in these structures, it is important to discuss the SSAS Database Management.
- SSAS operates on two major components :
  * Business Intelligence Studio
  * SQL Server data tools
- We were taught various components of SSAS like cube designing, cube creation, performing action, deployment of cube etc.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
